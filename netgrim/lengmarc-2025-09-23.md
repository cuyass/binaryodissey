HTML - organizes a webpage content and how it's seen.
XML - stores the webpage content/info, it also sends its content from one page to another
CSS - styles the website
Different HTML tags: <b>, <i>, <br> -- they are predefined
Markup languages ≠ Programming languages
Markup language = structure with syntax that allows you to format a document, it doesn't compile
Programming Language = performs functions and operations to display a result, it's compiled
XML is for databases?
XML tags -- they are not predefined, they are created by the user
DTD - Document Type Definition = it's the header, where it's defined what kind of language and what version it is
  XML version -- 1.0
  encoding -- UTF-8
