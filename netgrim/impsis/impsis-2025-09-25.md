# Netgrim - Operating Systems Implementation 1

## 1. 0verv1ew
- C0urse: Operating Systems Implementation
- Class: 1
- T0p1cs c0vered: what is an operating system?; computer parts;

## 2. Key C0ncepts, N0tes

system software: it manages and coordinates hardware's and software's function
application software: programs that are installed inside the operating system
programming/developing software: basically any IDE
network operating system: an OS that needs internet connection to manage and coordiante of a number x of computers

Von Neumman architecture: input device/s (dispositivo de entrada) -> RAM/CPU -> output device/s (dispositivo de salida)
> Process!
> ALU: aritmethic-logic unit = a component of CPU
> CPU interprets what is in RAM (processes) and sends it/them to output device

RAM = volatile memory
Hard drive = permanent memory
OS architecture - interfaces <-> services (ie processes, memory, network, output/input, files, security Manager) <-> core/kernel
commands... cd, mkdir
kernel
shell
> GUI
> CLI
