## 2. Key C0ncepts, N0tes

**Kernel** - system resources manager (i.e. CPU time and memory), "it's like an air traffic controller".
**Open Source** - software whose source code is made freely available to the public for others to view, use, modify, and distribute under specific licensing terms.
**Operating System** - fundamental system software that manages a computer's hardware, software resources, and provides common services for applications.
**UNIX** - family of multitasking, multi-user computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969, run in C.
**Linux** - family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Run in C like UNIX.
**GNU** - extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux.
**Distros** - operating system that includes the Linux kernel for its kernel functionality. Different distros: Red Hat, CentOS, Scientific Linux, Open SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, big etc.
**Application and its processes** - An application is a user-facing software program designed to perform specific tasks, such as a word processor or web browser. A process is a running instance of a program's instructions within a multitasking operating system, allowing the computer to execute multiple processes concurrently.
**Commands** - instruction, typically given to a computer or software, to perform a specific task. Commands can be saved as alias or functions.
**Rolling Release** - continuous delivery in software development, frequently delivering updates to applications (Liberación Contínua en español)

I already had a vague idea of all of this, but putting the work in looking up for definitions of the things that were being discussed helped me cementing this basic knowledge!
